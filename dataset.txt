['As one of important biophysical parameters of vegetation,vegetation biomass estimation not only is necessary for studying productivity,carbon circles,and nutrition allocation in terrestrial ecosystem but also important to the natural resources management since the amount of vegetation biomass directly influences human utilization patterns of surface vegetation and affects other biophysical parameters.Remote sensing techniques make it possible that scientists examine properties and processes of ecosystems and their interannual variability,and monitor biophysical parameters such as biomass etc over broad areas at multiple scales because satellite observations can be obtained over large areas of interest with high revisitation frequencies.Vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index(INDV),Enhanced Vegetation Index(IEV) and soil adjusted vegetation index(SAVI) etc obtained from satellite data are useful predictors of biomass and productivity in grasslands.In this paper relationships between the above-ground grassland biomass and green dry matter from the field measurements in North Tibetan Plateau from August to September 2004 and the INDV and IEV from the corresponding MODIS remotely sensed data from the EOS/MODIS Receiving Station in the Tibet Remote Sensing Center and the MOD13Q1 products from LPDAAC with 250 m resolution are established,and the impacts of climate conditions and elevation on the above-ground grassland biomass are analyzed as well.Exponential relations exist between above-ground grassland biomass or green dry matter and vegetation indices(INDV,IEV).The correlation coefficients between above-ground grassland biomass and INDV,and IEV are 0.793,and 0.706;and those between green dry matter and INDV,and IEV are 0.833,and 0.769,respectively.It is apparent that the INDV can more effectively estimate grassland vegetation biomass in North Tibetan Plateau.Furthermore,based on the relationship between INDV and ground data,the spatial distribution of above-ground grassland biomass and green dry matter in North Tibetan Plateau are mapped at a scale of 250 m.The above-ground grassland biomass and green dry matter decrease from above 2000 kg/hm2 in the southeast to blow 200 kg/hm2 in the northwest of North Tibetan Plateau.The main factors affecting the spatial distribution of above-ground grassland biomass in the study area are the precipitation(correlation coefficient= 0.64) and temperature(correlation coefficient= 0.44).There is a negative relationship(correlation coefficient=-0.29) between above-ground grassland biomass and elevation in the study area,which means that the elevation has negative impacts on vegetation productivity in North Tibetan Plateau.', 'ustainable development is to serve the needs of all human beings in the world.The development of human society is from generation to generation,so inter-era fair is the basic element of sustainable development.According to the different understanding the"generation",the "fair" has different meanings in different societies.The paper analyzes the meanings,patterns and principles of the interera relations,especially researching the inter-era fair meanings and principles,then some implementation strategies are focused on the sustainable development of human resources according to the pressure-state-response,the sustainable use of natural resources based on analyzing the Edge Worth Box,the non-cooperative game theory resulted from the use of objective and priority on the contemporary generation of environmental pollution.The paper provides innovative theory and implementation strategy for sustainable development on the principle of inter-era fair.', "Climate has the natural attributes of an ever changing,dynamic resource as well as the social attributes found in all public resources.These features are common to and equally distributed for all of humanity.In China,present legislation has not addressed the non-exclusive nature of climate as a public resource and responsibility.There are no provisions in the current civil law or in constitution that deal with any ownership of the climate.Furthermore,civil law and the constitution do not deal with the issue of ownerships for public natural resources or the stateowned natural resources.Therefore,based on symbiosis theory,protecting China's climate resources is a balance among the multiple interests of mankind.This article suggests that the right to enjoy and use climate resources should be equally shared among all of humanity and that these needs should be addressed in China's current legislation.Such legislation needs to create a strengthening of the national management obligation of climate resources.However,any legislation should prevent climate resources from becoming a state-owned property."]

['As a big country in foreign trade,China has been dramatically developing,and obtained enormous trade surplus in terms of monetary value.However,the environment deficit in terms of environmental indicators has become increasingly prominent and serious,gradually forming the situation of "exporting products abroad and remaining pollution at home".An input-output model was used to calculate the export monetary value and virtual emissions of sulfur dioxide(SO2),carbon dioxide(CO2) embedded in products in foreign trade in 2002,2005,and 2007.Inter-annual changes in them and the impact on economic growth and emissions of pollutants,from foreign trade and typical industries,and from five dimensions of the export monetary value,virtual emissions of SO2,CO2 virtual pollution intensity,and contribution of "economy and pollution" were investigated.Results show that the export monetary value and emissions of export virtual pollutants were huge,and had a great proportion in GDP and national total emissions.Furthermore,the economic contribution was less than that of pollution contribution,especially in the typical industries.For 2007,the "economy-pollution ratio" in most typical industries was less than 1.The pollution contribution tended not to be neglected in foreign trade.However,the potential of energy-saving and emission-reduction can be further exploited.Emissions of export virtual SO2 embedded in products decreased by 10.4%,and the CO2 emission intensity was reduced 21% between 2005 and 2007.In addition,The 12th Five-Year Plan also puts forward clear and rigid bound targets in energy saving and emissions reduction.It is suggested that the foreign trade has great potential in energy saving and emissions reduction in the 12th Five-Year Plan.From the size perspective,the total pollutant emission target,appreciation of the RMB exchange rate,and export tariff and quotas will play an active role.From the structural point of view,the industrial structure of the secondary and tertiary industry was unreasonable,which was 93% and 6.4% in 2007,respectively.The potential of the structure in energy saving and emissions reduction was not realized in the 11th Five-Year Plan.Experience from developed countries shows that structure adjustment contributed 70% in energy saving and emissions reduction.From the technical point of view,it would be greatly helpful in encouraging and promoting enterprises to use technology of energy saving and emissions reduction,and improving the resource-environment efficiency of products.Developing recycling economy and promoting low-carbon technologies will also play an important role.']

['In terrestrial soils,carbon(C) and nitrogen(N) fluxes are primarily controlled by small but highly bio-reactive labile pools,while long term C and N storage is determined by the long-lived recalcitrant fraction.Changes in the size of labile,recalcitrant,and microbial carbon and nitrogen pools as well as redistribution among them may considerably affect terrestrial soil C and N storage and turnover rates.Hence,analyzing the labile and recalcitrant fraction of soils may improve our ability to detect and predict changes in soil C and N dynamics.This study used OTCs(Open Top Chambers) and clipping plus dung application and sulfuric acid hydrolysis to quantify changes in the labile and recalcitrant C and N fractions in soils from alpine meadows in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.Further,the effects of warming and grazing on labile and recalcitrant C and N fractions and microbial biomass in these soils were investigated.Using OTCs to warm soils resulted in an increase of 2.25℃ in daily mean air temperature at 30 cm above the ground and an increase of 1.17℃ in soil temperature at 10 cm depth,yielding significantly decreased labile C and N pools along with diminished recalcitrant C pool in the short-term,indicating an increase in soil respiration.Grazing markedly increased labile C and N pools I due to dung application,resulting in increments of 567 mg C/kg dry soil(26.13%) and 28mg N/kg(11.21%).The effects of warming and grazing on labile and recalcitrant pools counteracted each other,which led to non-significant changes in the combined treatments.Although warming or grazing alone did not alter the microbial biomass C pool,the combined treatments greatly increased it,by an increment of 147 mg C/kg dry soil(41.91%).The interaction between grazing and sampling dates was significant and the effects of grazing decreased with time.For all measured pools,soil microbial biomass C and N showed significant interactions between warming,grazing,and sampling dates,indicating that microbial biomass C and N in these soils are very sensitive to environmental change.Our results suggest that climatic warming slightly affects organic C and N fractions in meadows where grazing occurs and the effects of nutrients returned to the ecosystem through dung deposition cannot be ignored.In the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,alpine meadow ecosystems are distributed widely.Climate warming and disturbances such as grazing are main anthropogenic factors that drive changes in the structure and function of these ecosystems.According to our research,the effects of warming and grazing on labile and recalcitrant C and N pools counteracted each other,thus warming and grazing might only have slightly effects on alpine meadow soil C and N storage in the short-term.']
